# Docker DevOps Kung fu

This repository defines Docker Style DevOps Kung fu.
 
For more information on what DevOps is, start by taking a look at this [slideshow](http://chef.github.io/devops-kungfu/). If you agree with the fundamental principles, wish to practice our forms, and apply the style to your professional life, you can join
our school by sending a pull request to this README file, and adding your name to the list of practitioners.

This school practices docker DevOps multi-platform CaaS, and our masters also teach a sub-style based on   [dockistry](http://chef.github.io/devops-kungfu/) stack strategies.

If you like most of what you see, but not all, or wish to emphasize different
things about your style - but you agree on the same fundamental principles - you
should can fork this repo and start your own school/style, or contribute to [dockistry](https://gitter.im/forktheweb/dockistry) 
by adding uploading your stack to our registry which is opensource driven and can be downloaded and utilized by anyone using the CLI.
